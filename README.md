# Belly-Button-Biodiversity
#### I designed an interactive dashboard that shows bacteria residing in the belly button that can be used to manufacture protein using Plotly.js and HTML/CSS.

## Project Overview
This project involved building a dashboard that showed data on bacteria that dwell inside the human belly button from a sample of hundreds of people. The dashboard, as depicted, displays each person's demographic information, top 10 bacteria discovered, how often they wash their belly button, and the bacteria cultures per sample.

## Live Dashboard

The live interactive dashboard can be viewed here:
